[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/ballantyne/mimi-server)

To put your encrypted secrets in the cloud, click the deploy button above and then clone the repo and add these configuration settings.  This repo should be very easy to modify so that it can be used with other cloud providers.  If someone wants to do that work I welcome the contributions.

```bash
  heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key
  heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret
  heroku config:set AWS_REGION=region
  heroku config:set AWS_BUCKET=bucket
```
